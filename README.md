Assignment Objective:
- **Create a tidy data set with the average of each mean and std variable for each activy and each subejct**

Once downloaded and unzipped, sourcing and running the run_analyis.R script in the same working directory as the unzipped raw data set will produce the tidy data set required by the assignment *as long as the Samsung data flie structure is not altered.*

**run_analysis.R assumes the data set is in the working directory and the file structure is unalterted.**

From the README.txt file in the UIC HAR data folder, the 
- X_<test/train>.txt files contain the observational data. Details on processing by authors can be found in features_info.txt
- features.txt file contains the variable names for the X_<test/train>.txt data
- activity_labels.txt contains the row descriptions for each observation in X_<test/train>.txt as defined in y_<test/train>.txt
- subject_<test/train>.txt contain the subject generating each observation in X_<test/train>.txt 


Required Libraries:
```
library(reshape2)
```

The output of run_analysis.R is a 180 x 68 data.frame. The variables are as follows:
```
activity: Factor w/6 levels "LAYING", "SITTING", "STANDING", "WALKING", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS" 
```
representing the 6 activities in which subjects enagaged to generate the observational data
```
subject: int 1:30
```
representing the 30 subjects that participated in the trials generating the observational data

 all numeric variables, each the average of all observations of the original variable for the given activity and subject. The naming convention for the averaged variable names is "AVE_" prepended to the original variable name.
 
The original variables from the UCI HAR data set used by run_analsis are the mean() and std() variables of the 33 signals generated by the Samsung accelerometer and gyroscope:
- 20 time domain signals: 

```
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
```

and 13 frequency domain signals

```
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
```

To generate the output, run_analysis.R does the following data manipulations:

1. Loads into R from the UCI HAR data files the variable names, subject keys, activity names, and only the mean() and std() columns required for analysis per the assignment.
2. Combines test and train data, appending subject and activty keys to each observation, merging activity descriptions by activty key, and finally adding column names and deleting the activity key column.
3. Melting the combined data frame with subject and activity as ids and the test and train variables as the measured variables.
4. d-casts the melted data frame using activity + subject ~ variables with the aggregate function mean.
